# Express Middleware Module Project

In this challenge, you build an API and write custom middleware that satisfies the requirements listed under the `Minimum Viable Product` section.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Setup and Submission

Your instructor should have communicated what submission method to use for this project during the Guided Project and in your cohort's Slack channel. If you are still unsure, reach out to Lambda Staff.

### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

- Wire the application together completing `api/server.js` and `index.js`.
- Write four custom middleware functions detailed below, in `api/middleware/middleware.js`.
- Use the custom middlewares in their appropriate places in the application (specific endpoints, entire routes or globally).
- There are endpoints in `users-router.js` to retrieve the list of `posts` by a `user` and to store a new `post` for a `user`.

#### Custom Middleware Requirements

- `logger()`

  - `logger` logs to the console the following information about each request: request method, request url, and a timestamp
  - this middleware runs on every request made to the API

- `validateUserId()`

  - this middleware will be used for all user endpoints that include an `id` parameter in the url (ex: `/api/users/:id` and it should check the database to make sure there is a user with that id.
  - if the `id` parameter is valid, store the user object as `req.user` and allow the request to continue
  - if the `id` parameter does not match any user id in the database, respond with status `404` and `{ message: "user not found" }`

- `validateUser()`

  - `validateUser` validates the `body` on a request to create or update a user
  - if the request `body` lacks the required `name` field, respond with status `400` and `{ message: "missing required name field" }`

- `validatePost()`

  - `validatePost` validates the `body` on a request to create a new post
  - if the request `body` lacks the required `text` field, respond with status `400` and `{ message: "missing required text field" }`

### Database Persistence Helpers

There are two helper files that you can use to manage the persistence of _users_ and _posts_ data. These files are `api/users/users-model.js` and `api/posts/posts-model.js`. Both files publish the following api:

- `get()`: calling find returns a promise that resolves to an array of all the resources contained in the database.
- `getById()`: takes an `id` as the argument and returns a promise that resolves to the resource with that id if found.
- `insert()`: calling insert passing it a resource object will add it to the database and return the new resource.
- `update()`: accepts two arguments, the first is the `id` of the resource to update and the second is an object with the `changes` to apply. On success it returns the updated record.
- `remove()`: the remove method accepts an `id` as it's first parameter and, upon successfully deleting the `resource` from the database, returns the number of records deleted.

The `users-model.js` includes an extra method called `getUserPosts()` that when passed a user's `id`, returns a list of all the `posts` for the `user`.

**All helper methods return a promise.**

#### Database Schemas

The _Database Schemas_ for the `users` and `posts` resources are:

##### Users

| field | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id    | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| name  | string           | required, unique                                    |

##### Posts

| field   | data type        | metadata                                            |
| ------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| id      | unsigned integer | primary key, auto-increments, generated by database |
| text    | text             | required                                            |
| user_id | unsigned integer | required, must be the `id` of an existing user      |

We have provided test data for the resources.

#### Important Notes

- Reset the database by executing `npm run resetdb`.
- Test your work manually using Postman or HTTPie. Run automatic tests by executing `npm test`.
- You are welcome to create additional files but **do not move or rename existing files** or folders.
- Do not alter your `package.json` file except to install additional libraries or add additional scripts. **Do not update existing libs**.
- In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results.

### Task 3: Stretch Goal

Only attempt once tests are passing 100%. **Work on a new branch to avoid breaking MVP!**

- Use `create-react-app` to create an application inside the root folder, name it `client`.
- From the React application connect to the `/api/users` endpoint in the API and show the list of users.
- Add functionality to show the details of a user, including their posts, when clicking a user name in the list.
- Use React Router to navigate to a `/users/:id` route to show the user details.
- Add styling!
